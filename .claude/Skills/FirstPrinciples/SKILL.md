# FirstPrinciples - Fundamental Analysis

First principles thinking based on physics-based reasoning: break problems into constituent parts, challenge every assumption, and rebuild solutions from fundamental truths.

## The Method

**DECONSTRUCT → CHALLENGE → RECONSTRUCT**

Inspired by Elon Musk's approach: "Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there, as opposed to reasoning by analogy."

## Workflow Routing

| Action | Trigger | Workflow |
|--------|---------|----------|
| **Deconstruct** | "break down", "deconstruct", "what are the parts" | Workflows/Deconstruct.md |
| **Challenge** | "challenge assumptions", "what's really true" | Workflows/Challenge.md |
| **Reconstruct** | "rebuild from fundamentals", "optimal solution" | Workflows/Reconstruct.md |
| **Full Analysis** | "first principles analysis of" | All three in sequence |

## Constraint Classification

### Hard Constraints (Physics)
- Cannot be violated
- Laws of nature, mathematics
- Example: "Objects cannot exceed speed of light"

### Soft Constraints (Policy)
- Could be changed with authority
- Regulations, company policies, budgets
- Example: "We only hire from top universities"

### Assumptions (Unvalidated)
- Believed true but not verified
- Often inherited from predecessors
- Example: "Customers won't pay more than $X"

## Analysis Framework

### Step 1: State the Problem
Clearly articulate what you're trying to solve.

### Step 2: Deconstruct
- What are the fundamental components?
- What are the underlying physics/economics/incentives?
- Strip away all abstractions

### Step 3: Challenge
For each constraint:
- Is this really a hard constraint?
- What evidence supports this?
- Who said this and why?
- Has anyone violated this successfully?

### Step 4: Reconstruct
- Given only the hard constraints, what's the optimal solution?
- What would you build if starting from scratch?
- What's preventing that solution?

## Output Format

```markdown
# First Principles Analysis: [Problem]

## The Problem
[Clear statement]

## Deconstruction
### Fundamental Components
1. [Component 1]
2. [Component 2]

### Underlying Principles
- [Principle 1]
- [Principle 2]

## Constraint Classification

### Hard Constraints
- [Constraint] - Reason it's truly immutable

### Soft Constraints
- [Constraint] - Who could change this

### Assumptions (Challenged)
- [Assumption] - Evidence against it

## Reconstructed Solution
[Solution built from fundamentals only]

## Implementation Path
[How to get from current state to optimal]
```

## When to Use

- "Why do we do it this way?" questions
- Cost reduction challenges
- Innovation blockers
- Process redesign
- Strategic decisions
