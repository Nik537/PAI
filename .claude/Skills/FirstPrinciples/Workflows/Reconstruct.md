# Reconstruct Workflow

## Process

1. **Start with only hard constraints**
2. **Design the optimal solution** ignoring all soft constraints and assumptions
3. **Identify the gap** between optimal and current
4. **Create migration path** from current to optimal
5. **Evaluate trade-offs** of the new solution

## Key Question

"If you were starting from scratch today, knowing what you know, what would you build?"
