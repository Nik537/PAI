# Deconstruct Workflow

## Process

1. **State the problem** clearly
2. **List all components** that make up the current solution/situation
3. **Identify the underlying physics** - what fundamental forces/incentives are at play?
4. **Strip abstractions** - remove all layers until you reach fundamental truths
5. **Document dependencies** between fundamental components

## Questions to Ask

- What is this really made of?
- What are the base materials/inputs?
- What are the fundamental forces at play?
- What would a physics model of this look like?
- If we removed X, what would remain?
