# Challenge Workflow

## Process

1. **List all constraints** currently assumed
2. **Classify each** as Hard/Soft/Assumption
3. **For each assumption:**
   - What's the evidence?
   - Who said this originally?
   - Has anyone violated it successfully?
   - What would happen if we ignored it?

## Challenge Questions

- "Why do we do it this way?"
- "Who decided this?"
- "What if the opposite were true?"
- "Has anyone ever..."
- "What's the worst that could happen if..."
